# C-Frost

C-Frost is a toolbox that helps convert [Frost](https://github.com/ayonga/frost-dev) in native C++ [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt) problems.
It has been noticed that running on native C++ significantly improves running speeds compared to running the mexed Ipopt version provided by Frost.

Frost has been tested on native Ubuntu 16.04 and on Ubuntu 16.04 running on [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
